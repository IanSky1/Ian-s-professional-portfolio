# Ian-s-professional-portfolio

This is my portfolio project for my Web dev class. I will be making changes and other updates to the portfolio periodically over the next several months. 

For this project, I created two files, one for html and one for CSS. I started working on the html outline first. I added some preliminary comments that I updated later on, and then I made sure to use those same comments once I was ready to transfer over to my css file.

Within the html document I included 4 sections for my portfolio. Those sections include an "About me" section, my current projects that I am working on, and my resume which I will upload later on.

At times when I got stuck, I referred back to previous challenges in regard to the page outline/formatting for both html and CSS.

For my CSS file, I first included comments that correlated with the section comments in my html file. I primarily did this to make the file easier to read and follow. Afterwards I made sure to include all of the various css selectors and their properties for each section in the html file. 

There is still a lot of work to be done to this portfolio and I will continue to add to it in my free-time.
